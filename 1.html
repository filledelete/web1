    <p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and <strong>has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its <u>caffeine</u> content.</strong> It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). </p>
